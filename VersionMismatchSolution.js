The solution involves ensuring that the versions of React Native and the third-party libraries are compatible.  You can check library documentation for version requirements.  Use a consistent version management strategy like the one below:

1. **Check Library Requirements:** Examine the `package.json` of `react-native-some-library` (replace with your library).  Look for a `peerDependencies` section which specifies the required React Native version.
2. **Adjust Package.json:** Update your project's `package.json` to specify the required React Native version and compatible versions of other libraries.  Using a version range might be helpful to allow for minor updates.
3. **Clean and Reinstall:** Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to ensure everything is correctly installed after adjusting versions.
4. **Version Locking (Recommended):** Employ package-lock.json (npm) or yarn.lock to lock down dependency versions and prevent accidental version conflicts in the future.

```javascript
// VersionMismatchSolution.js (example - adapt to your specific library and versions)
import { someComponent } from 'react-native-some-library'; // Ensure this library's version is compatible

// ...
<someComponent/>
```
