This error occurs when using a library that requires a specific version of React Native, but your project uses a different version.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, and the error messages may not be very informative. For example:
```javascript
import { someComponent } from 'react-native-some-library';

// ... later in your code...
<someComponent/>
```
This might result in vague errors like "Invariant Violation" or other cryptic messages that don't directly point to the version mismatch.
