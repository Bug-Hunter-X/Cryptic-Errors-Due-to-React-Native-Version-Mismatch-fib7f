# React Native Version Mismatch Bug
This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose bug in React Native: cryptic errors stemming from a version mismatch between your project and a third-party library.  The problem is exacerbated by vague error messages that don't clearly indicate the root cause.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when a library requires a specific React Native version but your project uses a different one. This leads to seemingly random crashes and unhelpful error messages (like "Invariant Violation").

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Observe the error when attempting to run the project (see `VersionMismatchBug.js`).
3. Refer to `VersionMismatchSolution.js` for the resolution.

## Solution
Carefully check the version compatibility of all third-party libraries against your React Native project's version.  Use package managers' version locking mechanisms (like npm's `package-lock.json` or yarn's `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistency.
